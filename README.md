# 🚀 Go (Golang) Learning Roadmap

Track your progress while learning Go.  
You can use this file directly or convert each section into GitHub Issues with checklists.

---

## 🟢 1. Go Basics (Language Core)
- [ ] Setup & Tooling (`go run`, `go build`, `go mod`)
- [ ] Project structure & modules
- [ ] Variables, constants, type inference (`:=`)
- [ ] Basic types: string, int, float, bool, rune, byte
- [ ] Type conversions
- [ ] Control Flow (`if`, `for`, `switch`, break/continue)
- [ ] Functions (multiple return values, named return values, variadic)
- [ ] Pointers (value vs reference, passing by reference)

---

## 🟡 2. Data Structures & Collections
- [ ] Arrays & Slices (length, capacity, backing array, append, copy, slicing)
- [ ] Maps (declaration, CRUD, check existence with `value, ok := map[key]`)
- [ ] Structs (initialization, field tags, embedding)
- [ ] Methods (value vs pointer receivers)

---

## 🟠 3. Deeper Language Features
- [ ] Interfaces (implicit implementation, empty interface, type assertions)
- [ ] Error Handling (`error` type, custom errors, `errors.Is`, `errors.As`, `fmt.Errorf` with `%w`)
- [ ] Packages (`init()`, exported vs unexported)
- [ ] Generics (type parameters, constraints) — Go 1.18+
- [ ] Reflection (`reflect` package basics)

---

## 🔵 4. Concurrency & Parallelism
- [ ] Goroutines (lightweight threads, function calls as goroutines)
- [ ] Channels (unbuffered vs buffered, `select` statement)
- [ ] Concurrency Patterns (worker pools, fan-in / fan-out, context cancellation)
- [ ] `sync` Package (WaitGroup, Mutex, RWMutex, Once)
- [ ] Atomic operations

---

## 🟣 5. Standard Library & Utilities
- [ ] I/O & Files (`io`, `os`, `bufio`)
- [ ] Strings & Formatting (`strings`, `strconv`, `fmt`)
- [ ] Time (`time` package, timers, tickers)
- [ ] Networking (`net/http` basics, JSON handling with `encoding/json`)
- [ ] Testing (`testing` package, table-driven tests, benchmarks & examples)

---

## 🔴 6. Advanced Topics
- [ ] Context (`context.Background`, `WithCancel`, `WithTimeout`)
- [ ] Error Groups (`errgroup` package)
- [ ] Custom Packages & Modules (semantic versioning, private modules)
- [ ] Performance (profiling with `pprof`, escape analysis)
- [ ] Memory Management (garbage collection basics)

---

## 🟤 7. Go in Practice
- [ ] Web Development (`net/http`, frameworks: Fiber, Gin, Echo)
- [ ] Database (`database/sql`, ORMs: GORM, Ent)
- [ ] Microservices (gRPC, REST APIs)
- [ ] Deployment (building executables, cross-compilation, Dockerizing Go apps)

---

## ⚫ 8. Ecosystem & Best Practices
- [ ] Go Modules & Dependency Management
- [ ] Project structure (standard layout)
- [ ] Logging (`log`, `zap`, `zerolog`)
- [ ] Configuration management (`viper`)
- [ ] Linters & formatters (`gofmt`, `golangci-lint`)
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Security practices (validations, safe concurrency)
