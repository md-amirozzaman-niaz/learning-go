## ðŸŸ¡ 2. Data Structures & Collections

This issue tracks progress for learning Go's data structures and collection types.

### Learning Checklist

- [ ] Arrays & Slices (length, capacity, backing array, append, copy, slicing)
- [ ] Maps (declaration, CRUD, check existence with `value, ok := map[key]`)
- [ ] Structs (initialization, field tags, embedding)
- [ ] Methods (value vs pointer receivers)
