## ðŸ”µ 4. Concurrency & Parallelism

This issue tracks progress for learning Go's concurrency and parallelism features.

### Learning Checklist

- [ ] Goroutines (lightweight threads, function calls as goroutines)
- [ ] Channels (unbuffered vs buffered, `select` statement)
- [ ] Concurrency Patterns (worker pools, fan-in / fan-out, context cancellation)
- [ ] `sync` Package (WaitGroup, Mutex, RWMutex, Once)
- [ ] Atomic operations
